This is a remake of the classic game of snake, built entirely in Python. pygame is required to run this game, and there are currently two supported game modes, snake and tron.

In snake, you play the standard game of snake by yourself, eating food and growing in size.

In tron, you play 1v1 against another snake but your trails do not end, and touching either trail ends the game.
