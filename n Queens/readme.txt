This is a project that provides all solutions to the n-queens problem, which is an adaptation of the 8-queens problem,
where any number can be given for the board size... more here: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eight_queens_puzzle

This program makes use of recursive functions in combination with multi-threaded workloads to solve this problem as fast as feasable.
This program gives all possible solutions including rotations for any board size given*

*Note, certain board sizes take a looooooong time to complete so I would stick to 10 and under unless you want to wait an hour
