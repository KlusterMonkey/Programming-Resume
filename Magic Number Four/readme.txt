I made this to demonstrate a theorey that goes something like this:

1. Take any number (positive or negative, doesn't matter). Ex: 13
2. Spell that number out. Ex: thirteen
3. Count the number of letters in that number. Ex: 8
4. Go to step 2

Eventually, every time, you will end up looping on the number 4, or 'four' because it is the only number
in the english language that has the same number of letters as it's numerical value. I wrote a simple program
to illustrate this.
